Hi! My name is Danil Lukinykh aka danluki. I'm 20 years old software developer from Russia.
My computer science journey started at the age of 16, when I decided to learn C#.
I graduated from high school in 11th grade and went to the univeristy in my small city and now I'm in second year of studying.
